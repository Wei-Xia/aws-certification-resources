Amazon data centers are surrounded by three physical layers of security. &ldquo;Nothing can go in or out without setting off an alarm&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s important to keep bad guys out, but equally important to keep the data in which is why Amazon monitors incoming gear, tracking every disk that enters the facility. And &ldquo;if it breaks we don&rsquo;t return the disk for warranty. The only way a disk leaves our data center is when it&rsquo;s confetti.”</p> <p>** Most (not all) data and network security are taken care of for you. When we talk about the data/network security, AWS has a &ldquo;shared responsibility model&rdquo; where AWS and the customer share the responsibility of securing them. For example the customer is responsible for creating rules to secure his network traffic using the security groups and is also responsible for protecting data with encryption.</p> <p>Option C:</p> <p>In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means it requires less time to make those resources available to developers - from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.</p> <p>Option B is not correct. The Physical infrastructure is a responsibility of AWS and not the customer. Hence it is not an advantage of moving to the AWS Cloud.</p> <p>Option D is not correct. In AWS, most of the services are available with no upfront costs as it follows the pay-as-you-go pricing.</p> <p>AWS allows you to pay upfront for some services to get more discounts, but you have the choice to pay upfront or pay as you go. By contrast, traditional IT providers require you to pay upfront for all of their services.</p> <p>Option E is not correct. As mentioned above, security is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.

IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>2) Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don&rsquo;t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>3) Software as a Service (SaaS) - Software as a Service (SaaS) provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email which you can use to send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintain the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.&nbsp;</p> <p>References:&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-technical-content/latest/aws-overview/types-of-cloud-computing.html" target="_blank">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-technical-content/latest/aws-overview/types-of-cloud-computing.html</a></p>', 'answers': [' A.

When you make a capacity decision before you deploy a system, you might end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with the performance implications of limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems can go away. You can use as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down automatically.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">2- Test systems at production scale: In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, and then decommission the resources. Because you only pay for the test environment when it\'s running, you can simulate your live environment for a fraction of the cost of testing on premises.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">3- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier: Automation allows you to create and replicate your systems at low cost and avoid the expense of manual effort. You can track changes to your automation, audit the impact, and revert to previous parameters when necessary.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">4- Allow for evolutionary architectures: Allow for evolutionary architectures. In a traditional environment, architectural decisions are often implemented as static, one-time events, with a few major versions of a system during its lifetime. As a business and its context continue to change, these initial decisions might hinder the system\'s ability to deliver changing business requirements. In the cloud, the capability to automate and test on demand lowers the risk of impact from design changes. This allows systems to evolve over time so that businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">5- Drive architectures using data: In the cloud you can collect data on how your architectural choices affect the behavior of your workload. This lets you make fact-based decisions on how to improve your workload. Your cloud infrastructure is code, so you can use that data to inform your architecture choices and improvements over time.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">6- Improve through game days: Test how your architecture and processes perform by regularly scheduling game days to simulate events in production. This will help you understand where improvements can be made and can help develop organizational experience in dealing with events.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Option A is not correct. Pay-as-you-go pricing eliminates the need to guess your capacity needs.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Option B is not correct. Reservations in AWS are not an appropriate choice when you need to test your AWS environment since it requires you to pay for at least one year.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Option D is not correct. In AWS, you can test and provision your resources on-demand and pay only for what you use with no long term contracts.

AWS products that fall into the well-understood category of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)&mdash;such as Amazon EC2, Amazon VPC, and Amazon S3&mdash;are completely under your control and require you to perform all of the necessary security configuration and management tasks.

The status of any instances that are unhealthy at the time of the health check is OutOfService. The load balancer routes user requests only to the healthy instances. When the load balancer determines that an instance is unhealthy, it stops routing requests to that instance.

Rather than having your IT team learns how to host and run a new technology, they can simply consume it as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that require expertise that is not evenly dispersed across the technical community. In the cloud, these technologies become services that your team can consume while focusing on product development rather than resource provisioning and management.</p> <p>2- Go global in minutes: Easily deploy your system in multiple Regions around the world with just a few clicks. This allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.</p> <p>3- Use serverless architectures: In the cloud, serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain servers to carry out traditional compute activities. For example, storage services can act as static websites, removing the need for web servers, and event services can host your code for you. This not only removes the operational burden of managing these servers, but also can lower transactional costs because these managed services operate at cloud scale.</p> <p>4- Experiment more often: With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.</p> <p>5- Mechanical sympathy: Use the technology approach that aligns best to what you are trying to achieve. For example, consider data access patterns when selecting database or storage approaches.</p> <p>Other options presented are related to security not performance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf" target="_blank">https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf</a></p>', 'answers': ['<p>A.

On a static website, individual webpages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts. To host a static website, you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting, allow public read access, and then upload your website content to the bucket. By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server-side processing, including server-side scripts such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET. Amazon S3 does not support server-side scripting.

It is infinitely scalable, has built-in redundancy, and is available to you on a pay-as-you-go basis. For example, if you want to deliver or stream video files to your global users, all you need to do is to put your content in an S3 bucket and create a CloudFront distribution that points to the bucket. Your user&rsquo;s video player will use CloudFront URLs to request the video file. The request will be directed to the best edge location, based on the user&rsquo;s location. The Amazon Cloudfront Content Delivery Network (CDN) will serve the video from its cache, fetching it from the S3 bucket if it has not already been cached. The CDN caches content at the edge locations for consistent, low-latency, high-throughput video delivery.</p> <p>Option B is not correct.

It is important that you make this an automated and repeatable process that avoids long lead times and is not prone to human error. The following approaches can be used to achieve this:</p> <p>**Bootstrapping: When you launch an AWS resource like an Amazon EC2 instance or Amazon Relational Database (Amazon RDS)DB instance, you start with a default configuration. You can then execute automated bootstrapping actions. That is, scripts that install software or copy data to bring that resource to a particular state. You can parameterize configuration details that vary between different environments (e.g.,production, test, etc.) so that the same scripts can be reused without modifications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>**Golden Images: Certain AWS resource types like Amazon EC2instances, Amazon RDS DB instances, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes, etc., can be launched from a golden image: a snapshot of a particular state of that resource. When compared to the bootstrapping approach, a golden image results in faster start times and removes dependencies to configuration services or third-party repositories.

(Choose two)</p>', 'relatedLectureIds': '', 'explanation': '<p>Advantages of Cloud Computing include:</p> <p>1- Trade capital for variable expense: Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you&rsquo;re going to use them, you can only pay when you consume computing resources, and only pay for how much you consume.</p>  <p>2- Benefit from massive economies of scale: By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers are aggregated in the cloud, providers such as Amazon Web Services can achieve higher economies of scale which translates into lower pay as you go prices.</p> <p>3- Stop guessing capacity: Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often either end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice.</p> <p>4- Increase speed and agility: In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only ever a click away, which means you reduce the time it takes to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.</p> <p>5- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers: Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking and powering servers.</p> <p>6- Go global in minutes: Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide a lower latency and better experience for your customers simply and at minimal cost.</p> <p>Option B is not correct.

If necessary, you can change or revoke an IAM user\'s permissions any time. (If you give out your root user credentials, it can be difficult to revoke them, and it is impossible to restrict their permissions.). Also Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it\'s usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.). Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group. That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.&nbsp;</p> <p>Option D is not correct.

It is a highly available and highly consistent database that supports ACID transactions. Basically, a transaction is one or more add, update, delete, or modify change to the database that must all be completed successfully or none of the steps should be executed. Transactional databases are useful when data integrity is important. If one of the steps in the transaction fail, then the steps must be rolled back to the state before any change was made to the database. An example of when you would need a transaction is when you make a banking transaction to move money from one account to another. If you successfully remove money from account A, but fail to add money to account B, then the transaction fails and the transaction must be rolled back so that the money is not taken from account A.</p> <p>Option A is not correct.

For example you can get improved fault tolerance by placing your compute instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer, as it can automatically balance traffic across multiple instances and multiple Availability Zones and ensure that only healthy Amazon EC2 instances receive traffic. You can setup an Elastic Load Balancer to balance incoming application traffic across Amazon EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone or multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing can detect the health of Amazon EC2 instances. When it detects unhealthy Amazon EC2 instances, it no longer routes traffic to those unhealthy instances. Instead, it spreads the load across the remaining healthy instances. If all of your Amazon EC2 instances in a particular Availability Zone are unhealthy, but you have set up instances in multiple Availability Zones, Elastic Load Balancing will route traffic to your healthy Amazon EC2 instances in those other zones. It will resume load balancing to the original Amazon EC2 instances when they have been restored to a healthy state. Also, using Auto Scaling enables you to greatly reduce the amount of time and resources you need to monitor your servers &ndash;if a failure occurs, a replacement will be automatically launched for you. Diagnosing an unhealthy server can be as simple as terminating it and letting Auto Scaling launch a new one for you.</p> <p>Option E:</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity (manually or automatically), both up and down, as your computing requirements change.</p> <p>Option B is not correct.
